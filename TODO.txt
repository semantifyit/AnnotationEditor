- enum flag if treated as single select or as node?
- range selection maybe without bootstrap row-col
- check remove prop where minCount: 1 with 2 props
- switch range on prop with restriction doesn't work(eg. aquarium ds) - fixed?

- new shacl props targeting data nodes
- webapi: check fields filled in on "next" click
